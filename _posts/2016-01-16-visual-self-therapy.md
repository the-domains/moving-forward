I created this series of images after being diagnosed with a potentially life threatening illness. Disbelief, fear and not knowing what comes next, created a powerful pendulum within me. Searching for a distraction and a coping mechanism, I chose to make images that reflected my emotional feelings towards my illness as a way of visual, self therapy. The image making process, along with medication were equally responsible for curing me of the illness I want to believe. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5d867042-e5f1-40be-9fd5-1e24597fc865.jpg)
